## üåç Live Demo

You can try the live version of JobScout here:

- [Frontend](https://jobscout.viettran.fi)
- [Backend](https://jobscout-api-f8ep.onrender.com)

## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project running locally:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- MongoDB (use MongoDB Atlas for remote DB or run a local instance)
- Docker (for containerized setup)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Viettranni/JobScout.git
cd jobscout
````

### Step 2: Setup MongoDB Atlas
Get your link from https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register and include it in your backend environment file.

Basically you Backend .env file would need the following:
MONGODB_URI,
JWT_SECRET,
OPENAI_API_KEY,
PORT

And the Frontend: 
VITE_API_URL="https://jobscout-api-f8ep.onrender.com"

### Step 3: Install Docker and run the the following commad

```bash
docker-compose up
````

Now you should have a working JobScout application. 

# üöß Deployment
### Deploying Backend
The backend is deployed on Render. You can configure the backend on your cloud provider (like Render or Heroku) using the same docker-compose.yml setup. Update environment variables accordingly.

### Deploying Frontend
The frontend is deployed on Viet's Vercel. You can build and deploy it to any platform that supports static site hosting, such as Render, Netlify, or Vercel.

# üîê CORS Configuration
To avoid CORS issues between the frontend and backend, make sure your backend's CORS configuration includes the frontend URL (both local and production):

```bash 
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: [
      "http://localhost:5173", // Local frontend
      "https://jobscout-frontend.onrender.com", // Deployed frontend
      "exp://192.168.0.108:8081", // Expo mobile app
      "http://localhost:5002", // For Docker
    ],
    credentials: true,
  })
);
````

# üìù Notes
- MongoDB Atlas is recommended for production to avoid managing your own MongoDB instance.
- You can modify the scraping logic in the backend to add additional job sources.
- Make sure your API is secured in production by using environment variables and secret keys.
